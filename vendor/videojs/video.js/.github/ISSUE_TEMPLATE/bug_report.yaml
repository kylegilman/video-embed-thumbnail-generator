        Thank you for using Video.js and contributing by opening an issue. Before you start, please check this list:
        * If you are not reporting a bug, but want to ask a general question, use [discussions](https://github.com/videojs/video.js/discussions) instead.
        * Check the [FAQ](https://videojs.com/guides/faqs) and [troubleshooting guides](https://videojs.com/guides/troubleshooting).
        * If there is an existing open issue for exactly the same problem, comment there instead.
          * However, be careful not to comment on old, closed issues, the new comment is unlikely to be noticed.
          * Take care to make sure it is really the exact same issue. If in doubt, open as a new issue.
        * If the issue is with a specific plugin, it's often better to open an issue on the plugin repository instead.
        * Please do take the time to give detailed information, and include a test case. A detailed issue with actionable information will get a better response than a vague anecdote.
